## First step

### Install the dependencies

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.  
It will also create the Git hooks with Husky if you Git version is recent enough.

Install the Git hooks to lint the code when creating commits.  
Run `npm run install-git-hooks`.

**Note:**

I didn't find a suitable way to "skip" the `postinstall` script in Heroku which was causing a deployment issue.

Run `npm run start` to start the local development server.

### Create the secret environment file

This step is mandatory.  
You must create the `secret-environment.json` file in the [environment folder](./src/environment/).

This file should contain at least:

- A discord Sonia secret token required by Discord API.
- A GitHub personal access token required by GitHub API.

**Shortcut:**

You can use a npm script to create the file for you.  
Run `npm run create-secret-environment`.

```json
{
  "discord": {
    "sonia": {
      "devGuildIdWhitelist": [],
      "secretToken": "REQUIRED_AND_TO_DEFINE_BY_ASKING_IT"
    }
  },
  "github": {
    "personalAccessToken": "REQUIRED_AND_TO_DEFINE_BY_YOU"
  },
  "profile": {
    "discordId": "OPTIONAL_AND_TO_DEFINE_BY_YOU",
    "nickname": "OPTIONAL_AND_TO_DEFINE_BY_YOU"
  }
}
```

**Note for the dev guild id whitelist:**

By default, when running locally Sonia (with `npm run start`) you will only be able to make this happen inside the Sonia Discord guild.  
This may not be of your convenience, so you can simply add into this list some personal Discord guild ids so that you can also test a Sonia feature in the guild(s) of your choice locally.

**Note for the Discord Sonia secret token:**

The Discord Sonia secret token is private and there are two ways to have access to it:

- Asks an admin (like [C0ZEN](https://github.com/C0ZEN)).
- Access to the [Discord bot page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/689829775317139460/bot) to reveal the token.

**Note:**

If somehow this token is made public, Discord will revoke it.

**Note for the GitHub personal access token:**

The GitHub personal access token is strictly personal to each developer.  
You have to create your own on your GitHub account.  
It should contain the following scopes:

- user
- public_repo
- repo
- repo_deployment
- repo:status
- read:repo_hook
- read:org
- read:public_key
- read:gpg_key

**Note for the profile:**

It is useful to distinguish developers running a local version of Sonia.  
On each message (plain text or embed) the nickname will appear.  
It can be anything you want however we recommend that you use your Discord name.

The Discord id will be used on simple text messages to use your name as a mention instead of pure text.  
If the Discord id is not set the username will be used instead as fallback.

### Create the Firebase service account file

This step is mandatory.  
You must create the `firebase-service-account-file.json` file in the [environment folder](./src/environment/).

This file should contain the fields to configure the project.  
Refer to this [article](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk) to learn how and why.  
Basically this is the private key of Sonia API.

There is one way to have access to it:

- Asks an admin (like [C0ZEN](https://github.com/C0ZEN)).

#### How does this works?

On local development - based on the environment variable `NODE_ENV` -, `dotenv` will read the [environment file](.env) to override the environment variables.  
To configure Firebase the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` will be used to define the path of the Firebase service account file.

On local production, `dotenv` is not used.  
Instead, the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is configured on the fly to point to the [dist](dist) folder.

The path of the Firebase service account file being different and "production" friendly we needed to come up with this configuration file.  
Since the solution must be production-first, some node scripts are creating a default Firebase service account file based partially on dedicated environment variables.  
GitHub and Heroku will handle the replacement with the configured secrets.

Now to avoid creating manually this file when using the local production the solution was to override this generated file with the one existing locally for the local development.

## Environment

This project use `dotenv` to load some environment variables locally only.  
On production the CI will provide his own environment variables.

`SHOULD_DISPLAY_MORE_DEBUG_LOGS` is used to display more logs.  
Locally it is enabled and should be most of the time disabled in production.

## Git

### Alias

This project uses an alias to push automatically with the upstream option set.  
The configuration of the alias is a [local one](.gitconfig).

This alias is used by the `cz` script to automatically push on the remote with a dynamic branch name.

**Troubleshooting:**

If the command `push-upstream` does not exists, you can link it to your git:  
Run `git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig`.

**_Note:_**

The error should be something like:

`git: 'push-upstream' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.`

## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  
This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  
The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **type** and the **subject** are mandatory.  
All the other stuff is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 144 characters!  
This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.  
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat** : A new feature
- **fix** : A bug fix
- **style** : Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf** : A code change that improves performance
- **test** : Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build** : Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies
- **docs** : Changes that affect the documentation
- **chore** : Anything else

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.  
For example `datepicker`, `dialog`, `app`, etc.

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".  
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behaviour.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.  
The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Monitoring

### Discord issues

Generic Discord error messages are sent to [Sonia Discord errors channel](http://discordapp.com/channels/689833865279307782/700770389655158924).  
These errors are coming from the Discord `error` event.

Generic Discord warning messages are sent to [Sonia Discord warnings channel](http://discordapp.com/channels/689833865279307782/701041732086792202).  
These warnings are coming from the Discord `warn` event.

Errors caught during Sonia's message processing are also sent to [Sonia Discord errors channel](http://discordapp.com/channels/689833865279307782/700770389655158924).  
These errors are also sent as a fallback message instead.

### Code issues

For code errors you can check the logs on [Papertrail](https://my.papertrailapp.com/systems/sonia-discord/events).  
Papertrail contains the full stack trace of the running server logs for seven days.
This is a good place to catch the errors thrown.

## Reminders

### Comments

In some cases (probably due to a lack of ingenuity so any help is wanted) during the development some features are linked.  
To help linking seem together we use comments to identify those cases.  
To identify them easily the following syntax is used:

`@see [sonia-link-XXX]{@link https://github.com/Sonia-corporation/sonia-discord/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sonia-link-XXX}` where `XXX` is an id.

Here is the list of linked features:

- [sonia-link-001](#sonia-link-001)
- [sonia-link-002](#sonia-link-002)

### sonia-link-001

Firebase guild versioning require to check if some features are available before using them.  
The data was created at some point so to avoid having side-effects a versioning was created.  
To avoid type errors a check is required and to avoid code duplication it is done in functions.  
When a new version is created this is required to update these functions as well.
This special comment help to identify the code required to be updated when a new release is available.  
I think that a workaround with types can be made but all I was not able to do it without losing the links between models and data.

### sonia-link-002

Due to Firebase being a dick when updating nested objects we can not use a proper typing system when updating the data.  
In fact we had to choose between two strategies:

- update the whole object
- update only the changed properties

We chose to only update the minimum as possible (solution 2) to avoid potential issues with multiple parallel asynchronous updates.  
So the main drawback is that the types are gone and any breaking change is not so easily spotted.  
Use this reminder to avoid to miss something when a breaking change occur.
