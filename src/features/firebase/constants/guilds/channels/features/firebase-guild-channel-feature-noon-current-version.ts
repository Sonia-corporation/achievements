 * This version is used when creating a [Firebase guild channel feature noon]{@link IFirebaseGuildChannelFeatureNoon}
 * This is useful to define which type of object is the guild channel feature noon in the Firebase store

 * Basically instead of altering each guild channel in the store when a new breaking change is released
 * The model should be upgraded before manipulating it
 * Each change should be followed with a breaking change strategy
